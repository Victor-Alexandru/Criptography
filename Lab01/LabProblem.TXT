Lab 1 (Weeks 1-4)
The programs may be written in any programming language available at the lab, and you will present
them with documentation. From your account in the campus network, you will access the directory
\\win\Criptografie_predare , create a directory of the form Surname-Name and a subdirectory with
the name Lab1, and place your project there.
Problem: Classical cryptography.
• You will be assigned one of the following ciphers during the labs:
1. Caesar cipher.
2. Substitution cipher.
3. Affine cipher.
4. Belaso cipher.
5. Hill cipher (for m = 2).
6. Permutation cipher.
• Create a project with the following features:
(i) A graphical interface. The alphabet will have 27 characters: the blank and the 26 letters of the
English alphabet.
(ii) Given an encryption key and a plaintext, encrypts the plaintext. There will be a key validation
and a plaintext validation.
(iii) Given an encryption key and a ciphertext, computes the decryption key and then decrypts the
ciphertext.
Points
• 1.5p if handed in by Week 5 or Week 6.
• 1p if handed in by Week 7 or Week 8.
• 0.5p if handed in by Week 9 or Week 10.
Note. Each student will keep her/his semigroup for the lab throughout the semester! Taking and
presenting labs in weeks with a changed parity may only be done in exceptional cases, if the teaching
assistant agrees with it and if time allows.
